#  FIHI token

FIHI is a token that was launched on the Tron [Blockchain](https://tronscan.io/#/). FIHI is a  token. FIHI has inherited all features of TRX, its most remarkable ones being high transaction speed and low transaction costs.

FIHI coin is Blockchain based decentralized crypto currency which runs on Tron Blockchain designed for the file sharing and storage of data. Where we can keep data securely in decentralized cloud storage without third party interference. There will be no issue of loosing data as feared in the centralized cloud storage providers. FIHI coin holders will have multiple benefits in future.

The result is an overall cost reduction for the consumer. FIHI bringing Cloud storage on a public Blockchain network and acts as a distributed, decentralized storage facility that makes it more efficient and cost-effective.

# Who are the creators of FIHI?

In the world of blockchain , and particularly concerning cryptocurrency , the first principle is to protect identities and secrets of assets and inventories, with the purpose of protecting people's interests from any risk.
Activities of FIHI Coin are mostly focused on decentralized cloud storage data centres, and identities of the token creators have to be kept hidden in order to protect the interests of participants and investors and prevent the projects from any kind of risk. The identities of FIHI creators is not officially disclosed. It suffices to know that they are experts on markets and blockchain technology, and have participated in several other successful projects, the names of which cannot be disclosed due to the risk of interference with other projects or digital currencies. The validity of a token is defined by its activity type, progress and expansion of programs, future plans and compliance with them. FIHI Coin is a self-sufficient envirnoment that does not rely on any country, state, organization or person of any kind. All FIHI projects are funded first by members primary investments and then by FIHI sales. This process raises the innate value of the foundation and the token very much, because the rising of the value of this token then depends on efforts dedicated to make it more valuable not on any person or special program. Developers and members of the foundation willing to own FIHI shall have to buy it from projects or money exchangers at the same approved prices, and no FIHI shall be put aside for special people or managers. Frankly, all distributions of career platforms will be managed by [smart contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) and [DEFI](https://www.coindesk.com/what-is-defi) projects. All projects will be of open source type.
